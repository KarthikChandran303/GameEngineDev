1. There are two folders: Server and Client. The executables in both folders need to be running in order to start the game.
2. To start the server enter the Server folder and run the associated MakeFile. Then run ./main
3. To connect a client to the server enter the Client folder and run the associated MakeFile. Then run ./main
4. Use arrow keys to move the player. Press space to jump. Passing the right side of the screen activates a side scroll. Falling in one of the pits in the first scene respawns you.
5. Close a window to disconnect the current client being controlled.
